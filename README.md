# Online way:<br>
- Because i am a noob i don't know currently how to create menu for github pages. So if you want to test/try out a js project you will
have to add project name to this link https://danilonovakovic.github.io/p5js_exercises/ <br>
example: for project 'simplePaint' link will be https://danilonovakovic.github.io/p5js_exercises/simplePaint
<br><br>

# Offline way:</br>
- If you clone this repository you can go to this folder and do command (assuming you have npm p5 packet installed) in command prompt or terminal : p5 server <br>
and then open browser and go to http://localhost:5555 (default) and you will see menu with all projects in this repository ready to run and to mess around experiment with. <br><br>
(helpfull links: https://www.npmjs.com/package/p5-manager, and you also need https://nodejs.org/en/ installed to be able to use npm)
